## 🎞️ Scene: *The Code That Couldn't Compile*

> Rajat Sir storms into the dev room in a sweat-soaked kurta.  
He throws a buggy React portfolio on your desk and says:

> **"Beta... client ka review hai kal subah. If this site doesn't work by tonight... toh samajh jao!"**

This portfolio is **completely broken**, the client is furious, and YOU — the rookie React dev — are their last hope. Will you **debug or perish** under the spotlight?
